# Readme

Repository of algorithms and tests written in PHP.

Credit to GitHub Copilot for writing most of the code. My primary intent is to study how the algorithms work, not building them out. I may choose to build them out in another language without AI.

## How can you use this to review algorithms?

Review the tests and implementating for the various algorithms.
